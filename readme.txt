Step 1: Initially in a terminal, run TC.py(Transaction Coordinator) file to start the Coordinator 
Step 2: In another terminal,run the node.py to start a node. You can run multiple nodes in multiple terminals
Step 3: Start any transaction and choose to commit or abort the transaction as necessary.
Step 4: To simulate TC or node failure, introduce delay in corresponding code using 'time.sleep(10)' keeping in view of the node timeout
